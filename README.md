# Hi, I'm Mark — Backend-Focused CS Student @ Columbia 👋

I’m a Computer Science student at Columbia University who loves building scalable, reliable backends.  
I’ve shipped real-world systems—from a Java/Spring Boot cloud storage backend to an AI-powered ticket routing tool—and I’m always looking for ways to apply AI pragmatically in production workflows.

I care about **clean architecture**, **performance**, and **impact**. If a tool helps people do their jobs better or faster, I’m in.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 1. Cloud Storage Backend (Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Docker)  
A Dropbox-style backend with authentication, file upload/download, metadata tracking, and simulated distributed storage with replication for fault tolerance.  
- Implemented chunked uploads and file sharding for large files  
- Built secure sharing links with token-based access  
- Containerized with Docker and integrated CI/CD via GitHub Actions  
**Repo:** [🔧 markhryt/Cloud-Storage-Backend](https://github.com/markhryt/Cloud-Storage-Backend)  

### 2. AI-Powered Ticket Routing System (IP)  
Routes internal support tickets to the best-suited engineer based on skills, history, and availability.  
- Used lightweight NLP models to embed/score tickets, minimizing cost  
- Designed a preprocessing pipeline for deduplication & intent classification  
- Deployed as a monolith with REST endpoints  
**Repo:** [🔧 markhryt/AIssistant]([https://github.com/markhryt/AIssistant])  

### 3. SkyHigh — AI-Powered Frisbee for Rescue Missions  
Worked on a team that designed and prototyped an aerodynamic frisbee robot to collect rescue data mid-flight in critical situations where drones fall short.  
- Enabled quiet, low-cost deployment with onboard sensors and passive stabilization  
- Built multi-agent AI system (LLMs + object detection via Groq API) to identify people and hazards  
- Created a dual-server backend (ESP32 + FastAPI) and Streamlit-based dashboard for real-time insights
