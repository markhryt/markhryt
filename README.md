# Hi, I'm Mark — Backend-Focused CS Student @ Columbia 👋

I’m a Computer Science student at Columbia University who loves building scalable, reliable backends.  
I’ve shipped real-world systems—from a Java/Spring Boot cloud storage backend to an AI-powered ticket routing tool—and I’m always looking for ways to apply AI pragmatically in production workflows.

I care about **clean architecture**, **performance**, and **impact**. If a tool helps people do their jobs better or faster, I’m in.
